# Dev Notes

1. Always maintain the stable version tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.35 autoprefixer@10.4.17
2. For most component styling use the utility classes directly in your template for clarity and maintainability 
3. I've attached  project requirements document, design wireframe, copilot-instructions and my task list. I want you to step by step slowly. I'm learning to code so teach me how to do this project, but first of all I want you to assess my code, then you slowly tell me which files to edit and then when you are giving me the code, you have to let me be able to paste the code wholesale so that I can understand what's going on.
